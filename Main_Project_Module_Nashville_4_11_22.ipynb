        "You just started working for a real estate company and they are looking to make a huge investment into the growing Nashville area. Theyâ€™ve acquired a dataset about recent sales and want you to build a model to help them accurately find the best value deals when they go to visit next week. There is a concern that houses are going over their asking price and this dataset will help us observe that. Hint: You will have to create the dependent variable to understand whether it is over/under price (you can have multiple categories but remember the limitations of logistic vs decision tree type models).\n",
